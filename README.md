# MineAssist - StardewValley Mod
Want to kill an enemy by a sword but struck it with your pickaxe? Mining is pretty much different from other actions in Stardew Valley. One must act more quickly and especially in multiplayer mode where you cannot just open a menu and stop enemies. This mod provides a flexible key binding to make it easier to attack immediately regardless what was on your hand, eat foods with certain conditions without confirmation, craft staircase in one key and so on. As a general key binding mod, you can also use it in other situations.

## Compatibility:
This mod is compatible with SMAPI 3.0+ and any other SMAPI mod if the key settings are not conflict.

## Install
1.Install SMAPI 3.0+.
2.Download this mod and unzip it into Stardew Valley/Mods.
3.Run the game using SMAPI at least once.
4.Modify key binding setting in config.json as you like. For more information, see "README - config.txt" and "README - keys and commands.txt"
